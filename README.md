# Insulterator9000

## Elevator Pitch: 

 Don’t you want to just have a laugh? Need something to break the monotony of life that is silly and sometimes might not make sense? Introducing, THE INSULTERATOR 9000! An app designed to give you insults that aren't meant to be serious, but are also relevant to you! With our app, you have the ability to update your profile so insults are tailored to who you are, and what you’re into! Be prepared to roll on the floor laughing at the ridiculousness generated by our app! Be prepared to be “Insulterated”! 

## Initial setup for local usage (cloning from Github, installing npm packages):

To create a local instance of our project, navigate up to the top of the page and select "code". From there, you will see a dropdown with an https link and a clipboard icon. Click on the clipboard icon, go to your local terminal/gitbash and type "git clone" and then right click after that statement and hit enter. The repo should be cloned from Github. Once that occurs, cd into the folder for the insulterator, and then run command npm install, and all node modules should be installed to your local instance. 

## Motivation:

The motivation for the Insulterator 9000 was we wanted to give users a lighthearted experience with being given silly insults from an insult generating app. In light of all that is going on in this world, it's always healthy to have a good laugh!


## Method: 

The first step of our application is using verification. Using we're able to verify the user has logged in to the page, and has a token to navigate through the system. Using local storage, we've also taken basic id information to reference in our api methods, especially when we handle a delete profile. Once log out or profile deletion occurs, we clear out the local storage. On the insult generation, we take parts of the object within our database and randomize an insulted response, using an insult api we found. Using basic pre set templates with injected object based values, we create custom insults for specific variable types, such as one's job, favorite sport, or their hobby.
